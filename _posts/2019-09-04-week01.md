Why I decided to take a course on open source software:

I utilize open source software all the time from using Linux as my main operating system to programming frameworks like React. However, I haven't given much back to the open source community. I've wanted to contribute to OSS for a while now, but never found the time in my schedule to figure out where to start or how to contribute consistently. Taking this course puts me in a position in which I have already allocated time to contribute (that being the time I will be spending on this course). Also, I expect to learn about where to start and where to go from there, which saves me the effort of researching this myself and puts me in a position to continue contributing after the end of the semester.
