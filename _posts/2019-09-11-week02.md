Starting in open source:

I think my first contributions to an open source project should be towards user-facing documentation and then developer-facing documentation. Although my ultimate goal is always to contribute to the code of the project and maybe even design and implement my own feature, I think I would be more successful in achieving that goal by following a less direct approach. I would go from understanding the project from a user's perspective to understanding the project from a developer's perspective and then (hopefully) actually implementing my own part of the project.

The types of projects that I would like to try this with include productivity and developer tools like a [terminal-based dashboard](https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf) or a [blogging-framework](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).
