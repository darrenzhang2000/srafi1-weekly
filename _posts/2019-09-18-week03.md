## Class-related Activity
Starting my open source contributions with OpenStreetMap

[This article](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-open-source-before-you-use-it/) has 10 facts about open source, most of which I knew previously and some of which I learned recently. I already knew that a lot of the software I use is open source and that all the source code is open for everyone to look at, but I learned about the extent of open source. I learned that open source refers to more than just code. It can also refer to datasets that are curated by the public (like OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia). With this new knowledge, I made my first open source contribution to OpenStreetMap by adding Brooklyn Public Library WiFi information to the site (the addition can be found [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/74404218)).
